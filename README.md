# jQuery/Javascript Student Carousel
#### Weekend Coding Challenge

https://briannadickman.github.io/jQuery-Carousel/

This application was created as a weekend coding challenge, and is used to display the names and feedback for each student in the cohort. The carousel can be navigated with the buttons at the bottom, or will automatically advance after 10 seconds, looping back to the beginning once it reaches the last slide.
